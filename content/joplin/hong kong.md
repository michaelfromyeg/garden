## Itinerary

### Day 1

- Date: Monday, April 3rd
- Location: Hong Kong
- Highlights: Arrive in Hong Kong, check-in to Check Inn
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=2); cloudy

Arrive in HK, check-in to hostel. Grab lunch, check out the [Noonday Gun](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noonday-gun) (hopefully for 12pm!) Causeway Bay area, Monster building. (Explore stuff "to the right.")

Head back to work on CS3236 paper; grab a quick dinner when needed. Can walk over and view Symphony of Lights show at 8pm onward.

Actual: check-in, Monster Building, Quarry Bay Promenade, Lockhart Market (lunch), couple of British pubs (and pub trivia) in the evening (...followed up by a CSA call).

### Day 2

- Date: Tuesday, April 4th
- Location: Hong Kong
- Highlights: Arrive in Hong Kong, check-in to Check Inn
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=3); rainy

Start the day with more dim sum. More work (and hopefully wrap-up) on CS3236 paper.

Can maybe check out Waterfall Bay Park. Maybe toss in a night market. (Explore stuff "to the left.") Can start in the early evening, catch sunset, then back to work for a bit.

Consider squeezing in the peak on this day, too.

Actual: go for nice breakfast at a cafe, work. Can check out HSBC Building (1 Queen's Road), Central-Mid-Levels escalators, ferry area / Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.

For dinner, try to do Stanley Market. Can go for sunset. Can go a bit early and catch Rhino Rock as well.

### Day 3

- Date: Wednesday, April 5th
- Location: Hong Kong
- Highlights: Spend the day with Jacky; horse racing
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=4); mostly hot

**On Thursday** do this instead. Do The Peak early in the morning.

Jacky will take care of most of this one; will spend the day chilling, and end it off with horse racing. Should be fun!

Walking tour of Kowloon? Loop Kowloon (Walled City) Park, History Museum, Avenue of Stars, catch Symphony of Lights show.

Other ideas: Un Chau Estate, The Whampoa, Chungking

### Day 4

- Date: Thursday, April 6th
- Location: Hong Kong
- Highlights: Lantau Island
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=5); mostly sunny

Wake up early and head to Lantau Island. Go via cable car (preferable; faster... this is Ngong Ping 360) or ferry (slower; more scenic). See the Tian Tan Buddha, stroll down the Wisdom Path (very cool) to the Po Lin Monastery. Then check out Tai O (a traditional fishing village).

~~Head back to HK, and take the tram up to The Peak. (Or, do Sunset Peak.) Time it for sunset.~~ Go to Stanley market instead, since the weather is poor (no point in peak). If weather is nice, maybe do The Peak.

Can do some work and chill after!

TODO: this day Wednesday instead. Horse racing / Kowloon moved to Thursday.

### Day 5

- Date: Friday, April 7th
- Location: Hong Kong
- Highlights: A bit more exploring HK; spend the night out
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=6); cloudy, a bit rainy

Might be a good day to do Dragon's Back. Ask hostel if I can leave bag for the day.

Last day in HK. Do laundry early, pack-up, and do some work. Need to be at airport at ~10pm, so can't go out for too long.

Arrive in Vietnam ~1am.
