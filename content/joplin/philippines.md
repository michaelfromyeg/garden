## Itinerary

Hopefully the final one.

RIP Palawan. For another lifetime (i.e., hopefully in a few years).

### Day 1

- Date: Thursday, March 23rd
- Location: Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines (and Mactan Island)
- Highlights: Depart for Cebu City, dive on Mactan Island
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=5)

Leave for Cebu City at 1am from Singapore via Cebu Pacific 5J 548 (CA$163). Arrive around 5:15am. [Here](https://google.com/travel/flights/booking?tfs=CBwQAhpKagwIAxIIL20vMDZ0MnQSCjIwMjMtMDMtMjNyDQgDEgkvbS8wMXBfbHkiHwoDU0lOEgoyMDIzLTAzLTIzGgNDRUIqAjVKMgM1NDhwAYIBCwj___________8BQAFIAZgBAg&tfu=CmhDalJJWmtoemJXMUlhbGROUzJ0QlVHcFVkSGRDUnkwdExTMHRMUzB0TFhCbVozVTBNVUZCUVVGQlIxRlhkWGxaVFVSUVVrRkJFZ1UxU2pVME9Cb0tDUEYrRUFJYUEwTkJSRGdjY0pGYxICCAEiCAoGeEdya0Fl)'s the flight booking.

We can stay in a hostel on Mactan and dive in the area. Here's an [article](https://www.divescotty.com/scuba-diving/diving-mactan-cebu.php) about dive sites in the area.

Dive sites considered include Oceanplayer Dive (oceanplayer@naver.com), Sidive Diving Center, Scotty's Dive Center (divestaff@divescotty.com).

After diving, head to Cebu Backpacker's Hostel. It's close to the ferry for the morning.

### Day 2

- Date: Friday, March 24th
- Location: Bohol, Bohol, Philippines
- Highlights: Depart for Bohol by ferry, then spend the day exploring Bohol
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=6)

Explore the island for the day, on our own. Chocolate Hills is the main highlight.

[Here](https://www.bookaway.com/s/philippines/cebu-to-bohol?departuredate=2023-03-24&passengers=1)'s the link to the ferry. Take it from Cebu Pier 1 to the Tagbilaran City.

[Here](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ExternalLinkInterstitial?redirectTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorcyclerentalphilippines.com%2Fcategory%2Fmotorcycle-scooter-hire-locations-philippines%2F) is a website for motorbike rentals.

Stay near [Bohol Diver's](https://www.alonaboholdiversclub.com/) (info@boholdivers.com). Or Tropical Divers Dive Center (tropicaldiversalona@gmail.com), or Sierra Madre Divers Dive Centre (info@smdiversbohol.com), or Seaquest Dive Center (info@seaquestdivecenter.com). All roughly in the same area.

Could consider staying at [Mad Monkey](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Mad-Monkey-Panglao/Panglao-Island/316595?from=2023-03-24&to=2023-03-26&guests=2); it is within walking distance. Staying at the dive center is also reasonable.

When we arrive in Bohol, head straight to our hostel, drop our things, and go explore for the day. Can use a combination of grab and rented scooter to get around.

Sites to hit: Chocolate Hills (ends 5:30pm), Loboc River (can do cruise, ends 2:30pm), butterfly sanctuary, tarsier (monkey; ends 5pm), Bilar manmade forest, Baclayon Church and Museum, Sandugo (Blood Pact Shrine).

ATV ride? (Can do near Bohol.)

#### Day 3

- Date: Saturday, March 25th
- Location: Bohol, Bohol, Philippines
- Highlights: Dive on Bohol (and specifically, Panglao); spend the night
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=7)

A guide to dive sites in [Panglao](https://www.alonaboholdiversclub.com/scuba-diving-areas-in-bohol/dive-sites-in-panglao/).

Dive on day 2.

### Day 4

- Date: Sunday, March 26th
- Location: Oslob, Cebu, Philippines
- Highlights: Depart for Oslob in the morning, chill, then head to Moalboal
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=8)

[Here](https://book.phbus.com/en/travel/panglao/oslob?people=1&date=2023-03-26&direction=forward)'s the link to the ferry. It departs at 6:30am and arrives around 8am.

Can do the whale shark activity. [Here]'s a guide to [Oslob Bay](https://guidetothephilippines.ph/articles/ultimate-guides/oslob-cebu-travel-guide). Here's some [more information](https://sugbo.ph/2022/whale-shark-oslob-cebu-guide/). We may have time after to do a waterfall or something.

To get to Moalboal, take [the bus](https://cebuvisayantravel.com/how-to-get-to-moalboal-from-oslob/).

Spend the night in Moalboal. Some hostel options: [Chief Mau](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Chief-Mau-Moalboal-Cebu/Moalboal/271767?from=2023-03-22&to=2023-03-23&guests=0), Ananas, Maayong, Hangover.

**Revision:** the ferry to Oslob broke down. We'll skip the whale shark watching and head for Moalboal tomorrow.

Ideally, we could take the 6am ferry and cram canyoneering into the same day. Instead, only the ~8am ferry is bookable. Alas, we can still try to make canyoneering. If we don't, head to Moalboal and check out White Sand beach, Lambug beach, snorkel. On **day 2** in Moalboal, do canyoneering and snorkeling _instead_ of diving if we didn't do it on this day.

### Day 5

- Date: Monday, March 27th
- Location: Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines
- Highlights: Spend the day in Moalboal
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=9)

[Here](https://divehappy.com/diving-moalboal-philippines-a-quick-guide/)'s a guide to diving in Moalboal. For dive centers, emailed Dive Lab (handuck9@hotmail.com), Quo Vadis Dive Resort (booking@quovadisresort.com), Savedra Dive Center (info@savedra.com).

[Here's](https://gretastravels.com/sardine-run-moalboal-turtles/) a guide to the sardine run.

### Day 6

- Date: Tuesday, March 28th
- Location: Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines
- Highlights: Spend another day in Moalboal!
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=10)

Consider canyoneering, others. At Kawasan Falls.

At night, for Michael to make BKI, we'd have to go back to Cebu City. The flight is at 3am on Wednesday. Ideally back around 12am, so aim to leave Moalboal at 9pm. A bit later is OK.

TODO: transit options? Last bus goes at 6pm. Can try and book through hostel.

(Konstantin should stay an extra day and dive.)

### Day 7

- Date: Wednesday, March 29th
- Location: Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines
- Highlights: Depart for Kota Kinabalu.
- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=11)

Depart for Kota Kinabalu via a connection through Manila. Flight link is [here](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/booking?tfs=CBwQAhptag0IAxIJL20vMDFwX2x5EgoyMDIzLTAzLTI5cg0IAxIJL20vMDFfZzdmIiAKA0NFQhIKMjAyMy0wMy0yORoDTU5MKgJQUjIEMjgzNiIfCgNNTkwSCjIwMjMtMDMtMjkaA0JLSSoCWjIyAzUwMXABggELCP___________wFAAUgBmAEC&tfu=CnRDalJJVXpKMVFrWjVVRzFVUzBsQlVHZEJWSGRDUnkwdExTMHRMUzB0TFhCbWFIZ3pOVUZCUVVGQlIxRlhkMFE0UVhJdE5FRkJFZ3hRVWpJNE16WjhXakkxTURFYUNnakdiUkFDR2dOVFIwUTRISERVVVE9PRICCAEiAA).

### Day 8, 9 (Philippines)

One extra day can be spent in Moalboal, diving.

From here, $\text{Konstantin}^2$ can explore Cebu City (temple (??) of Leah, Cebu Taoist temple, eat at Larsian, Yap-Sandiego Ancestral house, Magellan's cross). North part of the island has many good activities, too.

### Day 8, 9 (Malaysia)

Arrive in Kota Kinabalu and join Brian's transfer. See information [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_h8R3lBFw05wVenWvt-XY0y8LEb9NJFFF2grQJ4DIg/edit). Copy the return flight from [this](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/s/rmEjPoaghnUAGFsm8).
