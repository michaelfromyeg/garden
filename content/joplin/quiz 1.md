# Quiz 1

Wednesday, September 20th, 2023.

## Learning Outcomes

- Define ethics and describe what constitutes an ethical issue
  - Ethics: the study of what is moral, especially as it pertains to a **society**
  - (Contrasted against morals, which are more of an individual thing!)
  - Or: ethics is the study of morality, morals is what people ought to do
  - "Ethical issues" involve actions (e.g., an application of data science) that impact humans in some way. It's usually a harmful impact that involves some sort of moral judgement. (For example, if a ML system racially profiles humans. That's bad!)
- Explain the need for ethics in data science
  - Data science often involves making predictions or support decision-making
  - If systems involve bias (or are otherwise unethical), could cause real world harm
  - ML algorithms "exacerbate the problem"... cheap and fast, ostensibly objective
- Identify common ethical issues in data science
  - AI systems for recruiting, jobs
  - AI systems for awarding loans
  - Self-driving vehicles
  - Judicial system; supporting bail, etc.
- A few bonus theories: subjective relativism, cultural relativism, divine command theory, ethical egoism
  - (Good bonus material!)
  - Also, **TODO:** message about CPSC 340 material
- Describe common ethical frameworks and how they can be applied to data science applications
  - **The Rights Perspective**
  - **The Justice or Fairness Perspective**
  - **The Utilitarian Perspective**
    - **Act Utilitarianism**
    - **Rule Utilitarianism**
  - **The Common Good Perspective**
  - **The Virtue Ethics Perspective**
  - **The Care Ethics Perspective**
- Imagine scenarios in which current technology could be used in unethical ways
  - Black Mirror!
- Evaluate and make arguments around data science scenarios using ethical theories (e.g., Kantianism, utilitarianism, virtue ethics etc.)
  - Example exercises in class; review readings
- Compare and contrast different ethical theories and explain the case for and against each one as they apply to data science
  - See above; see readings
