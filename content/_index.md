Welcome to my digital garden! 🧑‍🌾🌱

- This project is based on [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0), a wonderful digital garden tool
- It leverages [joplin-garden-worker](https://github.com/benlau/joplin-garden-worker) to source my notes from [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- It's still verymuchso a work-in-progress; let me know if you find typos or bugs!

Here are a few collections you can take a look at to get started.

- [joplin](./joplin/), a subset of the notes I've taken in [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org)
  - (...be warned: it's a mess!)
- [notes](./notes/), other loose ends and tidbits

Enjoy!
