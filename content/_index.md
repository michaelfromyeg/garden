Welcome to my digital garden! 🧑‍🌾🌱

- This project is based on [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0), a wonderful digital garden tool
- It leverages [joplin-garden-worker](https://github.com/benlau/joplin-garden-worker) to source my notes from [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)
- It's still verymuchso a work-in-progress; let me know if you find typos or bugs!
