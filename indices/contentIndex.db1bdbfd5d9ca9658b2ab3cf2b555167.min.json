Grab lunch, check out the [Noonday Gun](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/noonday-gun) (hopefully for 12pm!) Causeway Bay area, Monster building. (Explore stuff \"to the right.\")\n\nHead back to work on CS3236 paper; grab a quick dinner when needed. Can walk over and view Symphony of Lights show at 8pm onward.\n\nActual: check-in, Monster Building, Quarry Bay Promenade, Lockhart Market (lunch), couple of British pubs (and pub trivia) in the evening (...followed up by a CSA call).\n\n### Day 2\n\n- Date: Tuesday, April 4th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n- Highlights: Arrive in Hong Kong, check-in to Check Inn\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=3); rainy\n\nStart the day with more dim sum. More work (and hopefully wrap-up) on CS3236 paper.\n\nCan maybe check out Waterfall Bay Park. Maybe toss in a night market. (Explore stuff \"to the left.\") Can start in the early evening, catch sunset, then back to work for a bit.\n\nConsider squeezing in the peak on this day, too.\n\nActual: go for nice breakfast at a cafe, work. Can check out HSBC Building (1 Queen's Road), Central-Mid-Levels escalators, ferry area / Sun Yat Sen Memorial Park.\n\nFor dinner, try to do Stanley Market. Can go for sunset. Can go a bit early and catch Rhino Rock as well.\n\n### Day 3\n\n- Date: Wednesday, April 5th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n- Highlights: Spend the day with Jacky; horse racing\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=4); mostly hot\n\n**On Thursday** do this instead. Do The Peak early in the morning.\n\nJacky will take care of most of this one; will spend the day chilling, and end it off with horse racing. Should be fun!\n\nWalking tour of Kowloon? Loop Kowloon (Walled City) Park, History Museum, Avenue of Stars, catch Symphony of Lights show.\n\nOther ideas: Un Chau Estate, The Whampoa, Chungking\n\n### Day 4\n\n- Date: Thursday, April 6th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n- Highlights: Lantau Island\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=5); mostly sunny\n\nWake up early and head to Lantau Island. Go via cable car (preferable; faster... this is Ngong Ping 360) or ferry (slower; more scenic). See the Tian Tan Buddha, stroll down the Wisdom Path (very cool) to the Po Lin Monastery. Then check out Tai O (a traditional fishing village).\n\n~~Head back to HK, and take the tram up to The Peak. (Or, do Sunset Peak.) Time it for sunset.~~ Go to Stanley market instead, since the weather is poor (no point in peak). If weather is nice, maybe do The Peak.\n\nCan do some work and chill after!\n\nTODO: this day Wednesday instead. Horse racing / Kowloon moved to Thursday.\n\n### Day 5\n\n- Date: Friday, April 7th\n- Location: Hong Kong\n- Highlights: A bit more exploring HK; spend the night out\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/hk/hong-kong-island/3558176/daily-weather-forecast/3558176?day=6); cloudy, a bit rainy\n\nMight be a good day to do Dragon's Back. Ask hostel if I can leave bag for the day.\n\nLast day in HK. Do laundry early, pack-up, and do some work.

Here's an [article](https://www.divescotty.com/scuba-diving/diving-mactan-cebu.php) about dive sites in the area.\n\nDive sites considered include Oceanplayer Dive (oceanplayer@naver.com), Sidive Diving Center, Scotty's Dive Center (divestaff@divescotty.com).\n\nAfter diving, head to Cebu Backpacker's Hostel. It's close to the ferry for the morning.\n\n### Day 2\n\n- Date: Friday, March 24th\n- Location: Bohol, Bohol, Philippines\n- Highlights: Depart for Bohol by ferry, then spend the day exploring Bohol\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=6)\n\nExplore the island for the day, on our own.

Or Tropical Divers Dive Center (tropicaldiversalona@gmail.com), or Sierra Madre Divers Dive Centre (info@smdiversbohol.com), or Seaquest Dive Center (info@seaquestdivecenter.com). All roughly in the same area.\n\nCould consider staying at [Mad Monkey](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Mad-Monkey-Panglao/Panglao-Island/316595?from=2023-03-24\u0026to=2023-03-26\u0026guests=2); it is within walking distance. Staying at the dive center is also reasonable.\n\nWhen we arrive in Bohol, head straight to our hostel, drop our things, and go explore for the day. Can use a combination of grab and rented scooter to get around.\n\nSites to hit: Chocolate Hills (ends 5:30pm), Loboc River (can do cruise, ends 2:30pm), butterfly sanctuary, tarsier (monkey; ends 5pm), Bilar manmade forest, Baclayon Church and Museum, Sandugo (Blood Pact Shrine).\n\nATV ride?

Here's some [more information](https://sugbo.ph/2022/whale-shark-oslob-cebu-guide/). We may have time after to do a waterfall or something.\n\nTo get to Moalboal, take [the bus](https://cebuvisayantravel.com/how-to-get-to-moalboal-from-oslob/).\n\nSpend the night in Moalboal. Some hostel options: [Chief Mau](https://www.hostelworld.com/pwa/hosteldetails.php/Chief-Mau-Moalboal-Cebu/Moalboal/271767?from=2023-03-22\u0026to=2023-03-23\u0026guests=0), Ananas, Maayong, Hangover.\n\n**Revision:** the ferry to Oslob broke down. We'll skip the whale shark watching and head for Moalboal tomorrow.\n\nIdeally, we could take the 6am ferry and cram canyoneering into the same day. Instead, only the ~8am ferry is bookable. Alas, we can still try to make canyoneering. If we don't, head to Moalboal and check out White Sand beach, Lambug beach, snorkel. On **day 2** in Moalboal, do canyoneering and snorkeling _instead_ of diving if we didn't do it on this day.\n\n### Day 5\n\n- Date: Monday, March 27th\n- Location: Moalboal, Cebu, Philippines\n- Highlights: Spend the day in Moalboal\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=9)\n\n[Here](https://divehappy.com/diving-moalboal-philippines-a-quick-guide/)'s a guide to diving in Moalboal.

At Kawasan Falls.\n\nAt night, for Michael to make BKI, we'd have to go back to Cebu City. The flight is at 3am on Wednesday. Ideally back around 12am, so aim to leave Moalboal at 9pm. A bit later is OK.\n\nTODO: transit options? Last bus goes at 6pm. Can try and book through hostel.\n\n(Konstantin should stay an extra day and dive.)\n\n### Day 7\n\n- Date: Wednesday, March 29th\n- Location: Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines\n- Highlights: Depart for Kota Kinabalu.\n- Weather: [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/en/ph/cebu-city/262768/daily-weather-forecast/262768?day=11)\n\nDepart for Kota Kinabalu via a connection through Manila.
