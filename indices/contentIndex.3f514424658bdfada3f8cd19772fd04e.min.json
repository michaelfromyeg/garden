(`SMAC`, `ROAR`, `ParamILS`, or `random`?)**\n  - Can queue model builds to run Tuesday night; will take some of Tuesday to put on cluster\n- Skim EPM paper again\n- Sync with Chris at 11am\n- Prepare e-mail to EPM authors or runnable steps (and repository quality improvements)\n  - Schedule send for tomorrow\n- Re-run Devon's repository with re-built models; prepare plots\n  - All vertical?! Will look at tomorrow\n\n## 2023-08-01\n\n- Build new, more sophisticated models for for use with UP\n- ~~Verify EPM e-mail received~~ (message Kevin, Chris)\n  - Can run on Python 3.11 fine; needs `np.float` to be renamed `np.float64` (or 32) for use with later NumPy version\n  - Will do this after I verify the model outputs\n- Send Chris initial set of UP plots\n- Build plots for additional experiments (up vs. roar, or succinctly, `UPROAR`, and `naive`), send to Chris\n- Verify model outputs; looks like its spitting out `log10` values\n\n## 2023-08-02\n\n- Change `make_prediction` helper for `SurrogateEnvironment` to transform prediction by `10 ** prediction`\n  - Send output for `anytime_experiment` to Chris; not sure what to make of the plots... but it is something\n- Clean-up and refactoring for `utilitarian_configuration` to make the repository runnable (all experiments, all environments, all datasets)\n  - Work on detailed instructions for the project at the moment; should be done EOD\n- (Initial) work on benchmarking `naive`, `kappa`, `speedup` experiments... why are they so much slower?\n  - Will leverage cluster to try to estimate how long these will take\n\n## 2023-08-03\n\n- Work through Chris' comments...\n  - More code clean-up for `up`; starting to get a better grasp of the codebase\n  - Take a look at initial `sup` work\n- Sync work on `narval`; prepare Slurm scripts\n- A bit of work on CDCL solver (from DPLL decisions) while waiting for jobs to run\n\n## 2023-08-04\n\n- Run jobs and create benchmarks for each experiment\n  - Goal is to produce ballpark figure for each (`h` hours, `d` days, etc.)\n- Work on complete report with instructions for presentation Monday\n- More work on CDCL solver while waiting for decisions\n","lastmodified":"2024-03-22T02:33:06.436197352Z","tags":[]},"/notes/non-joplin-note":{"title":"A note","content":"\n# A note\n\nThis is a not created manually (i.e., not from Joplin Garden Worker).\n","lastmodified":"2024-03-22T02:33:06.436197352Z","tags":[]}}
